# static-linux

* static-linux provides a number of linux distribution 
  independent static binaries.



Releases of static-linux can be found here:
	https://github.com/static-linux/static-linux-release 




Everything is a package as far as static-linux is concerned.
For example, the system skeleton itself is also a package 
and can be found in the repository corresponding to 
the machine architecture and release code name.


To build a static-linux release from binary packages run:
	./release.sh

To build a static-linux binary package repository from source 
code run:
	./build.sh

Most users will want to use the premade binary packages. If you 
decide to build a static-linux binary repository from source then 
the underlying buidroot build mechanism will require a number of 
dependencies. The dependencies for both methods are described 
below:
